Read on. Otherwise, jump down to the [Installation](#installation) section.\n\nJWT is a means of transmitting information between two parties in a compact, verifiable form.\n\nThe bits of information encoded in the body of a JWT are called `claims`. The expanded form of the JWT is in a JSON format, so each `claim` is a key in the JSON object.\n\nThe compacted representation of a signed JWT is a string that has three parts, each separated by a `.`:\n\n```\neyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJKb2UifQ.ipevRNuRP6HflG8cFKnmUPtypruRC4fb1DWtoLL62SY\n```\n\nEach section is [base 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoded. The first section is the header, which at a minimum needs to specify the algorithm used to sign the JWT. The second section is the body. This section has all the claims of this JWT encoded in it. The final section is the signature. It's computed by passing a combination of the header and body through the algorithm specified in the header.\n\nIf you pass the first two sections through a base 64 decoder, you'll get the following (formatting added for clarity):\n\n`header`\n\n```\n{\n  \"alg\": \"HS256\"\n}\n```\n\n`body`\n\n```\n{\n  \"sub\": \"Joe\"\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the information we have is that the HMAC using SHA-256 algorithm was used to sign the JWT. And, the body has a single claim, `sub` with value `Joe`.\n\nThere are a number of standard claims, called [Registered Claims](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1), in the specification and `sub` (for subject) is one of them.\n\nTo compute the signature, you must know the secret that was used to sign it. In this case, it was the word `secret`. You can see the signature creation is action [here](https://jsfiddle.net/dogeared/2fy2y0yd/11/) (Note: Trailing `=` are lopped off the signature for the JWT).\n\nNow you know (just about) all you need to know about JWTs. (Credits: [jwtk/jjwt](https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt))\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the package with:\n`yarn add react-native-pure-jwt`\n\nIf your React Native version supports autolinking, you should only run `pod install` on `ios` folder and you'll be good to go.\n\nIf not...\n\n`react-native link react-native-pure-jwt`\n\n**The linking process on the iOS version works with Cocoapods**\n\n### Manual Android linking\n\n- in `android/app/build.gradle`:\n\n```diff\ndependencies {\n    ...\n    compile \"com.facebook.react:react-native:+\"  // From node_modules\n+   compile project(':react-native-pure-jwt')\n}\n```\n\n- in `android/settings.gradle`:\n\n```diff\n...\ninclude ':app'\n+ include ':react-native-pure-jwt'\n+ project(':react-native-pure-jwt').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-pure-jwt/android')\n```\n\n- in `MainApplication.java`:\n\n```diff\n+ import com.zaguiini.RNPureJwt.RNPureJwtPackage;\n\n  public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {\n    //......\n\n    @Override\n    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {\n      return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(\n+         new RNPureJwtPackage(),\n          new MainReactPackage()\n      );\n    }\n\n    ......\n  }\n```\n\n### Manual iOS linking\n\nYou need to use Cocoapods at the moment. Open your `Podfile` and insert the following line in your main target:\n\n```ruby\npod 'react-native-pure-jwt', :podspec => '../node_modules/react-native-pure-jwt/react-native-pure-jwt.podspec'\n```\n\nThen run `pod install` and open your `.xcworkspace`\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nimport jwt from \"react-native-pure-jwt\";\n```\n\n- sign:\n\n```js\njwt\n  .sign(\n    {\n      iss: \"luisfelipez@live.com\",\n      exp: new Date().getTime() + 3600 * 1000, // expiration date, required, in ms, absolute to 1/1/1970\n      additional: \"payload\"\n    }, // body\n    \"my-secret\", // secret\n    {\n      alg: \"HS256\"\n    }\n  )\n  .then(console.log) // token as the only argument\n  .catch(console.error); // possible errors\n```\n\n- decode:\n\n```js\njwt\n  .decode(\n    token, // the token\n    secret, // the secret\n    {\n      skipValidation: true // to skip signature and exp verification\n    }\n  )\n  .then(console.log) // already an object. read below, exp key note\n  .catch(console.error);\n\n/*\n  response example:\n    {\n      headers: {\n        alg: 'HS256'\n      },\n      payload: {\n        iss: 'luisfelipez@live.com',\n        exp: 'some date', // IN SECONDS\n      }\n    }\n*/\n```\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### haste collision. react-native/package.json collides with Pods/React/package.json\n\nAdd this to your `Podfile`:\n\n```rb\npost_install do |installer|\n  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|\n    if target.name == \"React\"\n      target.remove_from_project\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n\n---\n\nFeel free to colaborate with the project!\n","maintainers":[{"name":"zaguini","email":"luisfelipezaguini@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2020-11-17T23:53:18.173Z","created":"2018-01-30T03:18:23.582Z","1.0.0":"2018-01-30T03:18:23.582Z","1.0.1":"2018-01-30T03:59:26.883Z","1.0.10":"2018-01-30T21:01:52.786Z","1.1.0":"2018-01-30T23:14:11.308Z","1.2.0":"2018-02-01T02:44:34.420Z","1.3.0":"2018-02-01T03:54:23.801Z","1.5.0":"2018-02-05T13:19:22.906Z","1.5.1":"2018-02-05T13:42:07.529Z","1.5.2":"2018-02-05T14:07:40.237Z","1.5.3":"2018-02-05T21:04:51.282Z","1.6.0":"2018-02-10T06:01:31.936Z","2.0.0":"2019-04-28T20:38:41.269Z","2.0.1":"2019-04-28T20:54:04.679Z","2.1.0":"2019-05-17T01:35:58.578Z","2.1.1":"2019-07-22T11:14:23.827Z","2.2.0":"2020-03-31T02:47:42.902Z","2.2.1":"2020-04-03T03:14:59.432Z","2.2.2":"2020-11-17T23:53:14.355Z"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/zaguiini/react-native-pure-jwt.git"},"author":{"name":"Luis Felipe Zaguini"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
